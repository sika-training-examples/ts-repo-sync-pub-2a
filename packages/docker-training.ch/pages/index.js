### What is Docker?
Docker can make your life easier through simplifying the process of R&D, testing, and software usage in your business. Run everything, everywhere. Donâ€™t lose your time waiting for server setups or random library updates. Have the environment as a part of your application.

A little bit of background about myself, I am a software engineer at Slush Pool and DevOps consultant, architect & lecturer. I lead mostly Docker courses and CI; they are both closely interrelated. I have four years of experience with Docker on the commercial development side. Other than that I use it daily for development, as well as production, and I cannot imagine working without it.

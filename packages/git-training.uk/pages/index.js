### What is Git?
Git is a modern versioning tool that has become an industry standard among developers. Individuals, startups and corporations use it on a daily basis. Git offers a simple simultaneous collaboration with more people on different parts of a project. You won't face the issue of disrupting each other's work or not being able to access the latest versions. The collaboration on a project can also be improved using Gitlab, a platform for the design, development and running of software projects.

### Course Description
During this one day hands-on workshop, you will find out why it is beneficial to use Git, how it works (why there are no substitutes) and best practices. You will be shown everything from the installation and basic Git setup, simple individual work in a one branch to work in a team with multiple branches using merge strategies (merge, rebase) and Gitlab. The pros and cons of both will be explained, and you can choose which one is better suited for your needs. Also, you will be shown how to get out of unexpected situations like 'I deleted everything by accident' etc.

A little bit of background about myself, I am a software engineer at Slush Pool and DevOps consultant, architect & lecturer. I have more than 7 years of experience with Git on daily basis of software development. I can't imagine the day-to-day work without Git. Next to source codes, I also version configuration and infrastucture (yes, using Terraform). I train the topics surrounding versioning and software development for over five years. This course is the one that I started with and is still popular.
